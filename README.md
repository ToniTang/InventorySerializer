InventorySerializer
===================

Simple inventory saving system that serializes inventories

There is only one command in this plugin with sub arguments:  
/kit (arguments)  
  - give
  - create
  - update
  - remove

It currently only works with OPs on the server. Probably will change it to individual permission nodes in the future. All inventories are saved within the "kits.yml" file inside the InventorySerializer folder.
